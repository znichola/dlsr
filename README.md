The harrypotter sorting hat as a logistic regression

We have a bunch of data for students and their scors in the various subjects at hogwards: "Flying", "Arithmancy", "Muggle Studies" ...

This data needs to analysed to see what "features" or subjects to keep.

Then we build a classifier using a logistic regression, and assign students to one of the 4 houses based of their grades.
